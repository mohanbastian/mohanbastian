<p align="justify">Hi George Mohan, a passionate self-taught full stack web developer from Singapore. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.</p>

<p align="justify">An accomplished and fluent communicator with a strong investigation, problem-solving and decision-making skills, combined with a pragmatic approach and sound business acumen. Software Engineering was a field that I found closely tailored to my personality as it intertwines both computer science and interpersonal skills.</p>
